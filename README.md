> **Backend • Machine Learning • Systems**

I’m interested in **backend arch** and **deep learning**. I like reading new ML papers and new ways top manage big data, system boundaries, and why designs fail under scale. I use **MERN stack** mostly because it’s fast to ship as asked by lients. Outside that, I build **MQL5 trading bots**, and I enjoy working closer to the metal—**C/C++**, memory and how abstractions are actually implemented.
